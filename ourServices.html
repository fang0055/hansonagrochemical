                <p>The shutdown of raw material plants has made pesticide synthesis difficult due to the stringent
                    environmental protection pressures. More and more Chinese manufacturers would like to source key
                    intermediates abroad to meet their demands.</p>

                <p>Hanson Agrochemical Consulting has been widely recognized and highly praised by the industry for its
                    customer-first, contract-credit, good-faith, cost savings, and fast registration. Hanson
                    Agrochemical
                    Consulting is very proficient in the operational procedures for pesticide registration in Canada
                    (PMRA)
                    and the United States (EPA), especially for data compensation.</p>
                <p>We have submitted 30+ product registrations to PMRA since 2014, and 8 active ingredients have been
                    issued
                    with registration certificates. </p>
                <p> More and more generic products will be commercially available in Canadian market, which will give
                    Canadian farmers an alternative crop protection tool, making Canadian agriculture industry more
                    robust

                </div>
                <p>China has become a powerhouse of new active ingredient (AI) discoveries, formulation innovations, and
                    pesticide application improvements, especially after ChemChina acquired Syngenta and Adama 2 years
                    ago.
                    Around 40 plus new AIs have been patented in the last decade, a few of them have been successfully
                    commercially launched in China and surrounding countries. </p>
                <p>Apart from that, China has been actively doing transgenic crop researches, such as gene-editing crops
                    that are equipped with various traits, such as high yield, adversity resistance, insect resistance,
                    and
                    herbicide resistance. </p>
                <p>As a consultant to a couple of multinational companies, we helped them acquire the bio fungicides,
                    diamide insecticide molecules recently. we listed the following the chemistries, and list of the
                    patent
                    holders for your references. I can bridge what you need and the patented molecules that Chinese
                    research
                    communities can offer, and we can get the non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and the material transfer
