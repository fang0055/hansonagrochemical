            <h4>Hanson Helps Chinese Pesticide Manufacturers Register Four AIs in PMRA</h4>
            <p>
                Since 2015, Hanson Industry Company has been a leader in bridging the Canadian crop protection market
                needs with Chinese Pesticide suppliers. We have successfully aided multiple Chinese pesticide
                manufacturers to register 4 technical products, which include glufosinate, florasulam, boscalid and
                s-metolachlor at PMRA, Health Canada. The registration certificate of glufosinate 200 g/L has been
                issued at PMRA. More generic active ingredients have been, and will be submitted to PMRA soon, which
                include formulations of glyphosate, glufosinate, clodinafop-propargyl 2,4-D, clethodim, pyraclostrobin
                and others. We also aid in the registration and commercialization of other products, such as plant
                growth regulators (PGRs), biostimulants, bio-pesticides, beneficial insects.

            <h4>Agrow China Top 30 Companies 2016</h4>
            <p>
                his is the first comprehensive China Top 30 Crop Protection Companies report, derived from primary
                market
                research throughout the regions and provinces. It is copiously illustrated throughout with totally
                original
                data. Given the current interest in China’s growing clout in the global crop protection sector, the
                authors
                believe there is further scope for both consolidation and diversification, both in the domestic market
                and
                beyond. The Chinese crop protection market is valued at US$ 5.2 billion at provincial distributor level,
                making it the third largest in the world. Around two-thirds of the market is generic, and domestic
                products
                account for 65%, while imported products account for 35%. The authors examine each major Chinese CP
                company
                in detail - their history and evolution; products; sales; manufacturing capabilities; market positioning
                and
                key drivers; and R&D pipeline strategies.
